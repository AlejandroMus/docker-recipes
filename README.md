This is a container library for the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).  The directory "bin/" contains convenience scripts that make Docker easier to use.  The following directories contain Dockerfiles for building container images that are used in processing EHT data.

- difx: the DiFX 2.5.1 package for correlating EHT observations.

- aips: the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS) for interactive calibration and editing of radio interferometric data.  To make Kazu Akiyama's AIPS pipeline work, both 31DEC16 and 31DEC17 are included in this image.

- aips-stack: AIPS with ParselTongue and the EHT Analysis Toolkit (EAT) to run Kazu Akiyama's pipeline.

- hops: the Haystack Observatory Postprocessing System (HOPS) for processing data generated by a MkIII, MkIV, or DiFX VLBI correlator.

- hops-stack: HOPS with EAT to run Lindy Blackburn's pipeline.

- eat: EAT, together with AIPS, HOPS, and useful python packages for analysis EHT data.

- eat-notebook: the EAT image with Jupyter Notebook support.

- eat-lab: the EAT image with Jupyter Lab support
